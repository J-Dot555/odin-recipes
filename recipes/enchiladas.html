	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
    The secret to these awesome chicken enchiladas is in the seasonings! I whipped these up on my own using ingredients I had on hand. Shredding the chicken is the most time-consuming step, but it's worth it in the end. Serve with sour cream and a side of Spanish rice. Give these babies a try!
